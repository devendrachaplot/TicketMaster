============
Quick Easy Automatic Ticket Booking on IRCTC (Including tatkal)
Tired of failed bookings, try our new Chrome extension to book tickets. This extension takes in user ticket details for booking on the site IRCTC and does automated ticket booking. When your session expires, we loop it up unless you book your ticket successfully.
Includes automatic captcha filling! ;)

Download extension from: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ticketmaster/dcmkppkofblmhjmodckjhbmpamhnlgac

Demo Video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4B78jQkq8I

EDIT: The extension has been discontinued after IRCTC changed their website.
